#step 1 load and open mothur 
module load mothur/1.48.0
mothur

#step 2 create stability files 
make.file(inputdir=., type=fastq, prefix=stability)

#step 3 make contiguous sequences 
make.contigs(file=stability.files, processors=4) 

#step 4 check how many sequences are remaining and how many were lost 
summary.seqs(fasta=stability.trim.contigs.fasta)
